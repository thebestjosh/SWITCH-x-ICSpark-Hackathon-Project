        "title": "What is Diabetes?",
        "content": "Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin.\n\nInsulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body's cells for use as energy.\n\nThere are several types of diabetes:\n\n1. **Type 1 Diabetes**: Your body doesn't make insulin or makes very little insulin. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to survive.\n\n2. **Type 2 Diabetes**: Your body doesn't use insulin well and can't keep blood sugar at normal levels. This is the most common type of diabetes.\n\n3. **Gestational Diabetes**: This develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes. It usually goes away after the baby is born, but increases the risk for type 2 diabetes later in life.\n\nIn Hawaii, diabetes is a significant health concern, with higher rates among Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders compared to other ethnic groups.\n\n## Understanding Traditional Hawaiian Approaches to Diabetes Management\n\nThis video discusses traditional Hawaiian approaches to managing diabetes, incorporating local foods and cultural practices.",

Understanding heart health is therefore especially important for our communities.\n\nCommon heart conditions include:\n\n1. **Coronary Artery Disease**: Narrowing of the blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with blood and oxygen\n\n2. **Heart Failure**: When the heart can't pump blood as well as it should\n\n3. **Arrhythmias**: Irregular heartbeats\n\n4. **Heart Valve Disease**: When heart valves don't work properly\n\nMany factors that increase risk for heart disease can be managed through lifestyle changes and medical care."
